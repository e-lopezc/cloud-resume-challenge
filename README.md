# cloud-resume-challenge

This personal project is inspired by the famous
cloud resume challege https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/

I believe is a great idea to learn aws services like s3, lambda, cloudfront, api gateway, route 53
and also infrastructure as code using terraform.
